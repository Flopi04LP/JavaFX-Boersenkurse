If you want to use the programm yourself you have to: 

1. Download the code and remove the .zip
2. Open the code in an IDE, only tested it in Netbeans 8.2 though
3. Add the .jar files from the /lib folder to the libraries
4. Excecute the Starter.java file

Done! If something doesn't work, you can leave an issue on this Github page
