# JavaFX-Boersenkurse / JavaFX-stock market prices

This is a Java-FX program that displays the current price of various Cryptocurrencies, their price change over the last week and a Browser for Stocks, where you can look up basic Data of a Stock. No fundamentals or anything fancy tho.
Still really cool  : )
